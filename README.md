# Coocoo4Cocoa
Proposal Topic: We're pulling data based on chocolate imports/exports per region. The purpose of this is to uncover answers to our following questions: 1) Who (which company) produces the best chocolate, ultimately, in each region? 2) Per region, where does the best chocolate originate (where's it imported from & company name)? 3) What is the average rating of chocolates per region? 4) Which company produces the best chocolate? & what is its location? 5) From the data gathered, does any of the countries listed use child labor in order to produce chocolate/cocoa?
